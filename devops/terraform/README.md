# Terraform

This section provides the Terraform code to manage the creation and destruction of the core AWS infrastructure used in the Vocabulary Manager application. To that end, the Terraform code is broken into separate components, each of which manages a certain key part of the AWS infrastructure. The folder **compute** contains the code for managing the fleet of ec2 instances with the help of an elastic load balancer to distribute the user-request workload appropriately across the fleet. The folder **network** contains the code for setting up a secure network in AWS to receive requests from users and send back the appropriate responses. Finally, the folder **storage** contains the code for setting up a persistence layer for data that is used to build the inference components of the Vocabulary Manager application (such as foreign-language dictionaries). This persistence layer consists mainly of s3 buckets and is distinct from the persistence layer for user data, which is handled by traditional database solutions elsewhere in the project.
