# AWS

This section contains code for interacting with AWS services that is not easily written in other languages like Terraform. The main functionality provided by this code is currently interacting with parameter stores but other functionality may be added when other higher-level AWS services (like AWS Translate or AWS Transcribe) are utilized.
