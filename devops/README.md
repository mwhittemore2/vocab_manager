# Devops

This section contains the code to support automatic scaling of the Vocabulary Manager application within the cloud. For our purposes, automatic scaling is enabled by the ability to easily deploy the application through containerization as well as create, manage and destroy the infrastructure for running the application through the infrastructure as code (IaC) paradigm.

The code is arranged according to one top-level directory for each technology used as part of the devops solution. Each of these directories contains further documentation explaining how the corresponding technology is used to enable automatic scaling of the Vocabulary Manager application.
