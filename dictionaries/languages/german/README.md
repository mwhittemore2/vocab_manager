To initialize the German dictionary service, you must first start an 
Elasticsearch instance. Once you have it initialized, you must create a 
config file that contains the index name (german), the language (german) 
and the route to the Elasticsearch service (typically http://localhost:9200).

Once this is done, make sure to activate the virtual environment with the
dependencies from this project's requirements.txt file. Next, add the full 
path on your machine to the directory vocab_manager/dictionaries to your 
PYTHONPATH variable (we'll call this full path $DICTIONARIES). At this point, 
assuming the variable $CONFIG points to the config mentioned in the previous 
paragraph, you can run the following command:

python3 $DICTIONARIES/create_index.py $CONFIG

This will initialize a text index for German documents in Elasticsearch.
Next, you have to run the ETL process to load the German data. You should
have three files for this process. First, you need the raw dictionary data to
be transformed and inserted in Elasticsearch. The full path to this file will 
be called $DATA. Next, you need a config file specifying how to interact with
Elasticsearch. The full path to this file will be called $CONN. Finally, you need
a config file with specific parameters for the ETL process itself. The full path to 
this file will be called $PARAMS.

Once these files are ready, you can run the following command in the same directory
as this README file:

python3 run_etl.py $DATA $CONN $PARAMS

Once the process finishes, the German dictionary service should be ready for use by 
other programs.
