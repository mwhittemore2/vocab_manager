This folder contains the front-end Javascript code for the document manager. The document manager
lets the user select a document to read and then displays the document in the browser. The user
can then select text from the document to translate and the translations will be displayed on the right side of the screen. More features will eventually be added, but the translation services
provided form the core utility of the E-book reader for foreign-language learners.

Assuming you have the dependencies specified by **package.json** installed, you can build the
project by calling **webpack** from this directory. The resulting Javascript code will then be
available at **vocab_manager/app/static/document_manager**.
